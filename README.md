# Pearson-Calculator
The Pearson correlation coefficient program is a C++ program that takes input from the user in the form of two vectors of float values, representing two variables X and Y.

The program calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient, which is a measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between X and Y.

The program uses the formula for calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient, which involves calculating the means, standard deviations, and covariance of the two variables. Once the Pearson correlation coefficient is calculated, the program outputs the result to the console in the form of a float value, indicating the strength and direction of the linear relationship between X and Y.

This program is a useful tool for analyzing and understanding the relationships between two variables, and can be applied in a wide range of fields, from scientific research to business and finance. The program can be easily modified or integrated into other programs to analyze data and make predictions based on the relationships between variables.

r = (nΣ(xy) - ΣxΣy) / sqrt((nΣx^2 - (Σx)^2) * (nΣy^2 - (Σy)^2))
